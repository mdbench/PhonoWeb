# PhonoWeb
PhonoWeb is a lightweight, deployable web application that lets users view and manage music files from a browser.

## Why is it called PhonoWeb?
The phonograph was the first music player. PhonoWeb was developed to provide a music player experience using web technologies.

## Why do we need it?
Browsers have become state of the art applications. Many apps available on app stores can be made with wider compatibility for fractions of the code-base and energy. PhonoWeb is only 500 lines of code at its base. Cybersecurity is getting harder and harder to achieve and an offline web app makes hacking virtually impossible, a breath of fresh air in a time of insecurity.

## Due-Outs
